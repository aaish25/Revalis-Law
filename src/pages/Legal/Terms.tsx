              attorney-client relationship is established, we cannot guarantee the same level of protection 
              as information covered by attorney-client privilege. Do not submit highly sensitive information 
              until we have confirmed representation.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Legal fees vary based on the complexity of your matter and the services required. Fee estimates 
              provided on this website are ranges and not guarantees. Specific fees will be detailed in your 
              engagement letter. Payment terms are typically net 30 days unless otherwise agreed.
